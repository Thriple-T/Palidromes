    "### Longest Palidrone Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "I started to build this with the logic from previous assignment `(palidrone assignment)`. However, based on the assignment requirement, I have to take a different approach towards this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is my thought process on this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The output should be a string which shows words that are palidrone. \n",
    "- Even the word itself not a palidrone, finds words that are palidrone within it.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these, I wanted a function that checks the left and right of each word checking if it matchs. Once they stop matching, it return the substring that was a palindrome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I need it to loop it through each words with the function I called `center` and put the palidrone in the empty string which I have called `longest` to update the palidrone with each iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed weird in the output when looping through words that are even and odd, so I establish an `if-else` in the `for` loop. If the length of the string is odd, it works the usual however, if it is even, the second argument has to be `i + 1` (the index is increased by 1). I have looped it through and the code works perfectly.   \n"
